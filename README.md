*A **S**potify **P**layer **Em**bedding Tool*

I don't have a Spotify account, but I do like to check out the playlists that people share.

Spotify don't make it easy to view the tracklist - but they *do* make it very easy to embed a public playlist. And those embedded playlists include a tracklist.

Run it yourself, or find it at [https://www.dmrutherford.com/spem/](https://www.dmrutherford.com/spem/).

I hope you find this as useful as I do. If you want to shower me with gratitude, I'm [@dmrutherford](https://twitter.com/dmrutherford) on Twitter.
